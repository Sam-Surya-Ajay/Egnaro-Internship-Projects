# 🧠 EGNARO Software Solutions – Deep Learning Internship Projects

**Organization:** Egnaro Software Solutions, Salem, Tamil Nadu, India  
**Role:** Deep Learning Intern (Team Lead)  
**Duration:** June 26, 2025 – August 7, 2025 (6 Weeks)

---

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains the internship projects developed during my Deep Learning internship at **Egnaro Software Solutions**.  
As part of the AI research and development team, I led the implementation of two core modules — **Object Detection** and **Distance Calculation** — aimed at building a vision-based perception system for robotics applications.

## 🧩 Projects

### 1. Object Detection Model
- Developed a robust **object detection system** using **YOLOv8**, **OpenCV**, and **Python**.
- Achieved **~90% detection accuracy** on a **custom dataset** of kitchen and restroom objects.
- Implemented **real-time detection** pipeline optimized for edge devices and robotics.
- Model designed for **integration with robotic vision systems** in future phases.

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `YOLOv8`, `OpenCV`, `Ultralytics`, `PyTorch`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`

**Folder:**  
`/Object_detection`

---

### 2. Distance Calculation Model
- Designed a **distance estimation model** to measure object distance from the camera using bounding box dimensions and geometric inference.
- Collected and preprocessed a **custom dataset** for accurate real-world performance.
- Built to **integrate seamlessly** with the object detection module to enable spatial awareness for robots.

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `OpenCV`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`

**Folder:**  
`/Distance_calculation`

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
From this internship, I gained practical experience in:
- Deep Learning and Computer Vision Model Development  
- Dataset Preparation and Model Evaluation  
- Integration of Detection and Distance Estimation Models  
- Applying AI, ML, and DL concepts to real-world robotic systems  

This experience deepened my interest in **Artificial Intelligence** and motivated me to pursue advanced studies in this field.
